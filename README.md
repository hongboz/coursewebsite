# coursewebsite

This is a project done by Hongbo Zhang and Kevin Liu for CSCB20. The project is a website design that could be used for any course as it includes features such as: a home page, working login system, links to syllabus, timetable, office hours and more.

The htdocs folder contains all the css and php files for the website and sql folder contains the sql dump file for the associated database.
